Welcome to my portfolio.

I am a software developer with a background in Environmental Studies and Geology. I taught myself JavaScript and last year I succesfully completed a 6 month full stack web development course. These days I am passionately coding away while learning how to rock climb.

Feel free to reach out to me!
