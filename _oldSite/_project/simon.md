This game is inspired by the popular 1970s game. On the first turn the game randomly chooses a color to highlight. The player has to memorize it and press the color. If the player remembers the color correctly, then the game adds another color. The player has to repeat the exact sequence every time. The game ends once the sequence hits 20 colors. The game is build using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap 4 library.
