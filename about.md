I am a software developer currently located in Santa Barbara, CA.

I have a background in Environmental Studies with a focus on Geology. I taught myself JavaScript and last year I succesfully completed a 6 month full stack web development course. These days I am passionately coding away while learning how to rock climb.

Feel free to reach out to me!
