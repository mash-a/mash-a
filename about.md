I am a software developer from Brooklyn, NY.

I have a background in Environmental Studies with a focus on Geology. While I interned as a research assistant at the American Museum of Natural History, I had the fantastic opportunity to contribute to a paper on microfossils. The work was intriguing and I loved every moment of it. However, I felt that this was not the area that I wanted to pursue a career in and I took some time off.

During that time I followed another passion of mine, animals. I adore all animals so being a pet care associate felt like second nature to me. It was no wonder I stayed with my company for 3 years. Every day I got to visit my furry friends and make new furry friends. Due to my excellent customer service, my love for animals, and my communication I was promoted to a senior pet care associate. The new promotion led me to develop skills such as mentorship and training techniques. My attention to detail also helped me spot the right fits for the company during onsite interviews.

However as much as I love animals and enjoyed being an integral part of a company, I needed to follow another path. This path led me to becoming a software developer. I already had the preqrequisites, a fire to learn, a love for solving challenges, and a deep interest in technology. All I needed was to learn JavaScript. I taught it to myself and jumped into a six month full stack web development course at Galvanize in SoHo, NYC. A few of my projects from that course are featured on this site. I received the certification from that course and decided that a new career deserved a change of pace as well. I moved to California and have been living here since September 2018. I am currently on the job hunt whilst learning sorting algorithms, learning how to rock climb, and working on some side projects. I love coding and the job hunt is just another challenge I'm solving :)

Feel free to reach out to me!
